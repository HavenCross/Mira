In the dim room, the computer screen shows the K-line, and the market keeps falling.
A cartoon character with a frog as his head puts his hands together and prays.
He keeps swinging his body up and down and prays for the K-line to rise, but the K-line keeps fluctuating.
Finally, a big negative line on the K-line on the monitor pierces a needle, and the frog collapses, with a hideous face and tears.
The overall image adopts the Japanese 2D anime style.
